Introduction
============

The Python-MIP package provides an interface to Mixed-Integer Linear
Programming solvers. The basic functionality allows the modeling,
optimization, problem modification, re-optimization and solution query.
Advanced features such as cut callbacks, MIPStarts and access to the solution
pool are also available. It comes with the open source `COIN-OR
<https://www.coin-or.org>`_ Branch-and-Cut solver `CBC
<https://projects.coin-or.org/Cbc>`_ but also works with the commercial solver
`Gurobi <http://www.gurobi.com/>`_.

This document is organized as follows: in the next Chapter installation
and configuration instructions for different platforms are presented.
Following, commented examples are included in Chapter 3. Finally, the
detailed reference information for the main classes is included in Chapter
4.
